You can implement the `Strlen` function both using `[]` operator and pointer operations. Here are the implementations for both methods:

Using `[]` Operator:
```c
int Strlen(char s[]) {
    int length = 0;
    while (s[length] != '\0') {
        length++;
    }
    return length;
}
```

Using Pointer Operations:
```c
int Strlen(char s[]) {
    int length = 0;
    char *ptr = s;
    while (*ptr != '\0') {
        length++;
        ptr++;
    }
    return length;
}
```

In both implementations, we iterate through the characters of the string until we reach the null terminator `'\0'`, which marks the end of the string. We increment the `length` variable as we go and return it as the length of the string.


You can implement the `StrCpy` function both using the `[]` operator and pointer operations. Here are the implementations for both methods:

Using `[]` Operator:
```c
void StrCpy(char dest[], char src[]) {
    int i = 0;
    while (src[i] != '\0') {
        dest[i] = src[i];
        i++;
    }
    dest[i] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the destination string
}
```

Using Pointer Operations:
```c
void StrCpy(char dest[], char src[]) {
    char *destPtr = dest;
    const char *srcPtr = src;
    
    while (*srcPtr != '\0') {
        *destPtr = *srcPtr;
        destPtr++;
        srcPtr++;
    }
    
    *destPtr = '\0';  // Null-terminate the destination string
}
```

Both implementations copy characters from the source string `src` to the destination string `dest` until they reach the null terminator `'\0'` in `src`. After copying, the destination string is null-terminated to ensure it is properly terminated as a valid C-style string.









You can implement the `Compare` function to compare two strings using both the `[]` operator and pointer operations. Here are the implementations for both methods:

Using `[]` Operator:
```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool Compare(char s1[], char s2[]) {
    int i = 0;
    while (s1[i] != '\0' && s2[i] != '\0') {
        if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
        i++;
    }
    
    // Check if both strings have reached their null terminators simultaneously
    return s1[i] == '\0' && s2[i] == '\0';
}
```

Using Pointer Operations:
```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool Compare(char s1[], char s2[]) {
    char *ptr1 = s1;
    char *ptr2 = s2;
    
    while (*ptr1 != '\0' && *ptr2 != '\0') {
        if (*ptr1 != *ptr2) {
            return false;
        }
        ptr1++;
        ptr2++;
    }
    
    // Check if both strings have reached their null terminators simultaneously
    return *ptr1 == '\0' && *ptr2 == '\0';
}
```

Both implementations compare the characters of the two strings one by one until they reach the null terminator `'\0'` in both strings. If at any point, they encounter different characters, the function returns `false`. If they both reach the null terminator simultaneously, it means the strings are the same, and the function returns `true`.







You can implement the `ToUpper` function to convert all lowercase characters to uppercase in the given string using both the `[]` operator and pointer operations. Here are the implementations for both methods:

Using `[]` Operator:
```c
void ToUpper(char s[]) {
    int i = 0;
    while (s[i] != '\0') {
        if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z') {
            // Convert lowercase to uppercase by subtracting 32 (the ASCII difference)
            s[i] = s[i] - 32;
        }
        i++;
    }
}
```

Using Pointer Operations:
```c
void ToUpper(char s[]) {
    char *ptr = s;
    
    while (*ptr != '\0') {
        if (*ptr >= 'a' && *ptr <= 'z') {
            // Convert lowercase to uppercase by subtracting 32 (the ASCII difference)
            *ptr = *ptr - 32;
        }
        ptr++;
    }
}
```

Both implementations iterate through the characters of the string and check if each character is a lowercase letter (between 'a' and 'z' inclusive). If a lowercase character is found, it is converted to uppercase by subtracting 32 (the ASCII difference between lowercase and uppercase letters).







You can implement the `ToLower` function to convert all uppercase characters to lowercase using both the `[]` operator and pointer operations. Here are the implementations for both methods:

Using `[]` Operator:
```c
void ToLower(char s[]) {
    int i = 0;
    while (s[i] != '\0') {
        if (s[i] >= 'A' && s[i] <= 'Z') {
            s[i] = s[i] + ('a' - 'A');  // Convert uppercase to lowercase
        }
        i++;
    }
}
```

Using Pointer Operations:
```c
void ToLower(char s[]) {
    char *ptr = s;
    while (*ptr != '\0') {
        if (*ptr >= 'A' && *ptr <= 'Z') {
            *ptr = *ptr + ('a' - 'A');  // Convert uppercase to lowercase
        }
        ptr++;
    }
}
```

Both implementations iterate through the characters of the string. If a character is an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z' inclusive), it is converted to lowercase by adding the difference between the ASCII values of 'a' and 'A'. This difference ensures the conversion to lowercase.
